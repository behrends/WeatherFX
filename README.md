# WeatherFX

A desktop app to store cities in a list. For each city, the current is displayed on selection.

Written in JavaFX and used as reference for a lecture at DHBW LÃ¶rrach (Programming II).

Add your API-Key for openweathermap.org (weather service) and your username for geonames.org (city lookup) in a file called config.properties like this:

~~~
api.key = YOUR_API_KEY_HERE (for OpenWeatherMap)
geonames = YOUR_USER_NAME_HERE (for geonames.og
~~~

config.properties needs to be placed in the app's root folder.
